## The AZ-400
AZ-400, titled "[Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-400/)," is a certification exam offered by Microsoft that focuses on assessing a candidate's knowledge and skills related to DevOps practices and solutions using Microsoft technologies. It focuses mainly on this five objectives
1\. **Configure Processes and Communications (10-15%)**: This objective involves setting up and fine-tuning communication and processes within a DevOps environment. It encompasses the use of various methodologies such as CMMI, Scrum, and Agile, along with tools like Azure DevOps Boards and Microsoft Teams channels. Teams visualize workflow and use agile methodologies, and a project wiki serves as a knowledge repository.

2\. **Design and Implement Source Control (15-20%)**: This objective centers around managing source code effectively. It includes implementing policies for code validation, utilizing Git features like mirroring and restoration, and understanding tools like BFG or Git-filter-repo and Git LFS. Candidates should also be proficient in branch strategies tailored to project releases.

3\. **Design and Implement Build and Release Pipelines (40-45%)**: This is a core aspect of DevOps, covering the creation and management of build and release pipelines. Topics include optimizing build pipelines with Azure Pipelines Caching, handling code artifacts for various platforms like .NET and Java, defining versioning strategies, configuring triggers, using service connections, setting up release gates, and managing hosted agents and retention policies.

4\. **Develop a Security and Compliance Plan (10-15%)**: Security and compliance are integral to DevOps. This objective entails creating a robust plan to ensure security throughout the application lifecycle. It may involve security validation plans, passive penetration testing, and implementing Azure Policies to enforce security and compliance standards.

5\. **Implement an Instrumentation Strategy (10-15%)**: This objective deals with monitoring and instrumentation for applications and services. Candidates should understand how to send data to Log Analytics workspaces, utilize the Kusto Query Language (KQL) for querying and analyzing data, leverage Application Insights for monitoring, and define metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to track application health and performance.

## Getting a free voucher (I know a lady)
Providence brought to me a band of cloud entusiast that post content centered around Cloud Technologies in our small group which I refer to as the "cloud tea". One of those posters(by Gbemisola LinkedIn Link is here) hinted me about the annual Microsoft Build challenge. Tthe "Microsoft Build Challenge," which is typically associated with their annual developer conference, is a component of the conference, aimed at engaging developers and encouraging them to build innovative solutions using Microsoft technologies and platforms.

After completing the challenge before the end date, one Microsoft Certification exam will be associated with your Microsoft Learn profile.
> **Note**: No matter how many Microsoft Learn Cloud Skills Challenges you complete, you can only earn one free Microsoft Certification exam.

## Preparing for the Exam
If you successfully completed the AZ400 challenge, you're already half-way there. 
- **'Microsoft Build: DevOps Challenge' Modules:**: The challenge contained about 51 daunting modules. It is really tempting to just skim over them but I would advise that you keep track and note down new terminolgies you come across.
  - Some of the modules have Azure DevOps labs. 
  - In conjjuction with using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) you may also incorporate the [Azure DevOps Portal](https://dev.azure.com/).
  - First time users can get credits for the Azure Portal. For Azure Devops portal, you might need to request free parallelism to run your pipelines.
- **Take a free practice assessment**: You can take a free practice assessment at the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-400/). Surprisingly, it's very similar to the actual exam.


## The Exam: What to expect
The exam question number might vary. I will obviosly not give too much detail about the exam because I signed some documents(basically ticked some boxes). With that in mind I think I can still reveal that it's divided into three segments
- First segment are multiple questions covering the five objectives mentioned earlier. You will find that the [free practice assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/exams/az-400/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=56) covers most of them. 
  - *Hint*: Play around with the `assessmentId` at the end of the url
- Second segment contains yes or no quesitons that test your understanding of a particular problem scenario and what solution best solves it
  - In this segment you are not allowed to review your answered questions
- Third segment: Usally provides a sort of real world scenario, you are provided details about an infrastructure and you are asked questions pertaining to it
  - When I said infrastructure, I refer to Networking, Authentication, Version Control systems choice and how best to navigate such scenario

## Exam Structure:
- **Open Book**: It was an awesome surprise when I found out the exam was an open book exam. Open in the sense that you get access to the Microsoft Learn portal **only**. Yes, you heard that right you get to use the Microsoft Learn Portal to help solve the questions.
- You also get breaks for as long as you need but it counts down against your total time.

## Retake:
[PearsonVUE](https://home.pearsonvue.com/MICROSOFT/onvue) handles Microsoft AZ400 certification exams and I am familiar with mainly two methods of taking the exam. Online with OnVUE, and In-Person at a test center.

I was able to snag a retake because I failed as a result of *technical difficulties* which wasn't from my part. The wonderful people at [PearsonVUE](https://home.pearsonvue.com/MICROSOFT/onvue) reached out to me, apologized, and offered a free voucher for any exam of my choosing valid for 1 year.
